# GroupFinder

This is a personal self-study project for me to get acquainted with popular Android libraries  
The app will use Yelp's public API to query business data in a given zipcode and display for the user

The project comes from Android tutorials from learnhowtoprogram.com
https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/android/

Currently intended libraries to be included are:  

          Retrofit
          Picasso
          Butterknife
          GSON
